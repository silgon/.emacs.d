;;;; `Cython' mode.

;; We define `cython-mode', a derived mode of `python-mode'.  We add some
;; font-lock keywords for things like cdef and cpdef, and we redefine some
;; `python-' functions to respect the additional cython keywords where
;; possible.  The advice is installed to not override in pure `python-mode'
;; buffers.
